**What is a Deployment?**
A Deployment provides basic functionality to manage the deployment of a Pod.
Its main objective is to be able to scale out a Pod with a ReplicaSet and smoothly handle updates to the Pods with its Deployment Strategy.
This should enable you to update your containers without causing any downtime.
