**What is an Innocent-Infra Application?**
An Innocent-Infra application is a semi-managed deployment of Kubernetes resources.
We convert Kubernetes resources from an easy to manage GUI interface to their natural Kubernetes configuration format. No abstraction is implemented.
We utilise ArgoCD as the tool that deploys the configuration in the GitOps methodology.
You can access ArgoCD's GUI and use it to manage the deployment of the Innocent-Infra Application.
