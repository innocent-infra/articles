**What is a Secret?**
A Secret contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key.
Using a Secret means that you don't need to include confidential data in your application code.

In our builder, we refer to secrets as Insecure Secrets, as it is better to provision secrets through a secret manager or an encrypted method.
This is because secret definitions are only base64 encoded.
We are planning on implementing an integration with [External Secrets](https://external-secrets.io/) into our builder, for this reason.
