**What is a Service Account?**
Kubernetes service accounts are Kubernetes resources, created and managed using the Kubernetes API, meant to be used by in-cluster Kubernetes-created entities, such as Pods, to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server or external services.
You can associate Roles to the service account by a Role Binding in order to grant it access to resources.
