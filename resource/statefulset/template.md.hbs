**What is a Statefulset?**
A Statefulset allows you to provision pods with a sequential and unique naming pattern.
The benefit of this is when you want to provision stateful resources which require the same resource associations if they are recreated.

It achieves this by registering all created pods to a headless service, which keeps track on which ids are available.

You can imagine it like this example:

The Statefulset is creating the pods, in accordance to the information in the headless service. The pods can be then created and attached to the correct predictable volume.

The Statefulset can then manage the release of new container versions, but allowing the pods to be upgraded, recreated and point to their old volume association.
