**What is this for?**
If our interface does not support your resource type, you can deploy a custom yaml configuration here.
This is likely to occur if you have installed a Custom Resource Definition which allows you to utilize non-standard resource types.

You can also use this interface to import existing Kubernetes configurations into our interface, they will automatically be converted to their relevant GUI element.
If a resource type is later supported by our GUI, then it will automatically be converted to its appropriate GUI element.

If you want to stop a resource from being converted into a GUI element, then you can give it the annotation of "innofra/ignore-gui".
